          We plan on creating an application  <br />which will act as an intermediary between users and NGO’s. Our application focuses to bring them to a <br />single digital platform for a tree plantation initiative. There is no need for the user to visit a NGO but instead they can use our application to send a request to NGO of their choice and ask them to plant a tree. In return the user has to pay the NGO for planting and maintaining the tree. <br />This acts as a benefit for both- user and NGO.<br /> Any user from any part of the world can request any NGO irrespective of their physical location. This application will help NGO’s get donations in form of tree plantation requests.
